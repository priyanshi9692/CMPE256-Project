# Predicting Movie Genre Based on Movie Title
It is estimated that there are almost 5 million movies ever made and it would be nearly an impossible task for an user to find his set of preferred movies, if the movies are not classified based on genres. The goal of this project was to predict which genres a movie would be classified based on the title of the movie.

In this project, a model has been built by leveraging various text processing techniques like 
- Tokenization
- Stemming
- Lemmatization

and a comparative study of four machine learning algorithms
 - logistic regression(LR)
 - decision trees (DTs)
 - random forest (RF)
 - support vector machines (SVM) 
 
 has been done in order to get best predictions on IMDb dataset.
